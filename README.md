# SQL-QUERY

In this project, I used the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to Query the International World Debt Staistics(IDS) data gotten from the World Bank open Data. 
My analysis covers from the contienent down to the country with the highest owed debt, with African Countries being my major focus.
